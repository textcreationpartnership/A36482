            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Compoſer of this Catechiſm adviſeth ſuch as are otherwiſe likely to be diſcouraged with the thoughts of learning ſo many Queſtions and Anſwers, to begin firſt of all with thoſe which are marked with <hi>Qu.</hi> and <hi>Anſw.</hi> in the Margin: After which they may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be better incouraged to learn the reſt; or at leaſt
<pb facs="tcp:97867:3"/> ſuch as are Printed in the ſame large Character. But whatever they learn, let them be careful, to deliver the ſame diſtinctly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out miſtakes, the neglect whereof hath occaſion'd great prejudice to many, which is much more eaſily prevented than remedied afterwards.</p>
            <p>He deſires alſo ſuch as are inclin'd to think divers of the proofs to be ſuperfluous, eſpecially in that part which treats of Relative Duties, to conſider that one Text of Scripture may adminiſter further light than another,
<pb facs="tcp:97867:3"/> which yet ſpeaks to the ſame thing: or elſe the manner of expreſſion, and the Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis being various, it may be to good purpoſe to produce diverſe Scriptures in ſome caſes, though the main in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of them be one and the ſame. In other places he hath omitted the proofs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together; to avoid prolixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and frequent quotation of the ſame Scriptures.</p>
            <p>He thinks it requiſit like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to ſignify, that the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Hymns are collected out of the Pſalms of <hi>David;</hi> ſeveral Verſes of divers
<pb facs="tcp:97867:4"/> Pſalms being placed under the ſame Head: and moſt of them different from the common and ordinary verſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or any other heretofore extant.</p>

Which is the ordinary way of reckoning in computation of time. When we read then that he was three days and three nights in

And the Apoſtles were at that time in the peoples ſtead, and Chriſt was the Miniſter or diſpenſer of the Sacrament. 2.

We muſt confeſs, that we were conceived in ſin and brought forth in Iniquity; and have lived as if the Lord did not ſee, and there were no knowledg in the moſt high. We have forſaken thee the Fountain of living waters, and hewn out unto our ſelves broken Ciſterns that will hold no water. We have been crrefull about many things, and neglected the one thing neceſſary. And now O Lord, what ſhall we ſay, for we have forſaken thy Commandments? Yet if thou wilt, thou canſt make us clean. Let the blood of Jeſus Chriſt thy Son cleanſe us from all ſin; and our iniquities do thou remember no more. Create in us a clean heart O God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new a right ſpirit within us, and let not ſin reign in our mortal bodies, that we ſhould obey it in the luſts thereof. Thou haſt commanded us to keep thy Precepts diligently. O that our ways were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to keep thy Statutes. Then ſhall we not be aſhamed, when we have reſpect unto all thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. Let ſuch a mind be in us, as was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in Chriſt Jeſus. Raiſe our hearts above this world, and all the things of it; that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce as though we rejoyced not, and weep as though we wept not; and uſe this world as not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing it, ſeeing the faſhion of all theſe things paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away. Feed us with food convenient for us, and give us Godlineſs with contentment, which is
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:97867:87"/> great gain. Let all thy dealings towards us be ſanct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ified, and all afflictions work together for our good. Open our eyes, that we may behold the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous things of thy Law; and ſo prepare us for Death and Judgment, that after this preſent life is ended, we may be received into thine everlaſting Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Add daily to thy Church ſuch as ſhall be ſaved, both of Jews and Gentiles. Bleſs theſe Nations, to which we do belong, forgive our ſins, reform and eſtabliſh us. Give our King thy Judgments O Lord, and teach our Senators Wiſdom. Bleſs all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of thy word, and grant that they may feed thy people with knowledg and with underſtanding. Bind up the broken hearted, give liberty to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and health to thoſe that are ſick. Hear the needy when he cryeth, the poor alſo and him that hath no helper. Let all our Friends and Relations find favour in thy ſight, and make this Family an Houſhold of faith. Be thou pleaſed to dwell among us, to dwell in every one of our hearts, and cauſe us to ſerve thee our God, and one another in love.</p>
            <p>And now bleſſed be the Lord, who daily follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us with his mercies. Thou haſt given us thy Laws and thy Statutes; and brought life and immortality to light through thy Goſpel. God ſo loved the world as to give his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life. Thou haſt been gracious unto us the day paſt, bleſſed be thy glorious name. Becauſe thou haſt been our help, therefore do we put our truſt under the ſhadow of thy wings. Be thou our Sun and our Shield, give us grace and glory, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold no good thing from us. Keep us now in thy fear and favour this night, who art the Keeper of Iſrael, and never ſlumbereſt or ſleepeſt.

            <p>O Lord, look down from Heaven with an eye of favour and compaſſion upon me thy poor Creature, who in and through Jeſus Chriſt do look up unto thee for mercy. I am a Sinner by nature and by practice, who deſerve to be caſt into everlaſting fire. But do thou deliver me from all my ſins. Give me thy grace, that I may not harbor any vain or wicked thoughts in my heart, that I may not lye or ſwear or take thy holy name in vain, or any other way offend thee with my tongue. Suffer me not to be guilty of ſtealing or any deceit; but grant that I may be true and faithfull and diligent in the place where thou art pleaſed to ſet me; knowing that thine All-ſeeing Eye obſerves me in the moſt ſecret corner, and that my own conſcience is more than a Thouſand Witneſſes. Inable me to flee youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full luſts, and to follow after Godlineſs, and ſuffer me not to be a Lover of Pleaſures more than of God. Prepare me for Death and Judgment; and cauſe me ſo to live in thy fear and favour while I am here, that whenever it ſhall pleaſe thee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move me hence, I may be received into a manſion in Heaven, and the full enjoyment of that Glory, which neither eye hath ſeen, nor ear heard, nor hath ever entred into the heart of man to conceive.</p>
